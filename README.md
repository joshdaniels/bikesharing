## Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike data
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau

## Overview
This Tableau story can be seen, in its entirety, at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/josh.daniels1595/viz/NYCCitibike_16411795562040/NYCCitiBike?publish=yes

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?
Results
While the demographics of Des Moines may be different from the make up of the citizenry of NYC, a cursory look at the makeup of CitiBike riders may shine light on who bikeshare might appeal to, regardless of locale.

## NYC CitiBike Customer Description

![Chart 1](https://github.com/joshdaniels/bikesharing/blob/main/images/customers.png)

we can see that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

## NYC CitiBike Top Trip Starting Locations

![Chart 2](https://github.com/joshdaniels/bikesharing/blob/main/images/start-locations.png)

The map displays the bike stations from which recorded bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness of the color indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. It is apparent that the bulk of the bike trips are originating in the bustling commercial heart of Lower Manhattan, known for towering office buildings, densely packed residential skyscrapers, and entertainment venues. Bike usage is lower in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.

## NYC CitiBike Total Rides by Time of Day

![Chart 3](https://github.com/joshdaniels/bikesharing/blob/main/images/peak-hours.png)

The chart displays the number of bike rides initiated during each hour of the day, totaled across the entire month of August. We can see peak usage during morning rush hour and end-of-workday commute times. What is also of note is the low-usage hours between 2 AM and 5 AM. These hours would be the best times to conduct bike repairs and redistribution of bikes from full stations to less-full stations.

## NYC CitiBike Peak Use Hours

A heatmap also helps show weekly usage patterns. Once again we can see the heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. 

## NYC CitiBike Bike Usage Spread

To see what proportion of the bikes get heavy usage, we can look at this stepped-level heatmap. 


## NYC CitiBike Avg. Trip Duration by Birth Year

![Chart 6](https://github.com/joshdaniels/bikesharing/blob/main/images/birthyear.png)

This charting of average trip duration by birth year shows two things:

* the bikeshare userbase covers all age demographics
* teenagers and early-twenty-somethings enjoy taking much longer bikerides than older users.


## NYC CitiBike Trip Duration

![Chart 7](https://github.com/joshdaniels/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trip%20usage.png) 

This graphing of number of trips by duration show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. 


## Summary
In conclusion, bikeshare services are  popular in metropolitan areas

The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers

And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

## additional lines of inquiry for analysis:

* trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour 
* average trip duration, by birth year, by gender
